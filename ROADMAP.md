# xplat GUI Implementation Roadmap

## Overview

This document outlines the plan for adding a graphical user interface (GUI) to the xplat utility. The GUI will provide a user-friendly alternative to the command-line interface while maintaining all existing functionality.

## Core Features

### 1. GUI Module Implementation
- Create new `gui.py` module in `src/xplat` directory
- Use Tkinter/ttk for a modern, native look and feel
- Implement a tabbed interface matching CLI commands:
  - Info Tab: System information display
  - List Tab: File/directory browsing and information
  - Rename Tab: Batch file renaming operations

### 2. Integration with Existing Code
- Reuse core functionality from:
  - `info.py` for system information
  - `list.py` for file operations
  - `rename.py` for file renaming
- Maintain consistency with CLI behavior
- Share common utilities and constants

### 3. User Interface Features
- Modern interface using ttk themed widgets
- Tabbed layout for intuitive navigation
- File browsing dialogs for directory selection
- Progress bars for batch operations
- Real-time operation feedback
- Platform-native look and feel
- Proper error handling with user-friendly messages

### 4. CLI Integration
- Add new `xplat gui` command to launch GUI
- Update `pyproject.toml` with new command entry
- Maintain CLI as primary interface
- Allow seamless switching between CLI and GUI

## Implementation Phases
