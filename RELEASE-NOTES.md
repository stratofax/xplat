# Release Notes

## v0.2.0 — Security Hardening & Agentic Red Team (2026-02-19)

We had 32 AI agents try to break our software before we shipped it. Here's what happened.

xplat is an open-source Python CLI tool for batch file management — renaming, listing, and converting files across macOS, Linux, and Windows. If you've ever needed to sanitize a folder of filenames for web upload or script a batch rename across platforms, that's what xplat does.

For v0.2.0, we wanted to see what happens when you treat AI agents as adversaries, not just assistants. Before cutting the release, we ran a red team analysis using 32 adversarial AI agents — each one independently probing the codebase for security weaknesses from a different attack angle.

They found real vulnerabilities:

- Glob injection through user-supplied file extension filters
- Symlink exploitation in the rename pipeline
- Batch rename collision attacks that could crash mid-operation

Every finding was fixed, covered by new tests, and verified before the code hit main.

The full picture for v0.2.0:

- 32-agent adversarial security analysis with all findings resolved
- 34 pytest tests passing at 99% coverage across 3 operating systems and 2 Python versions (3.12, 3.13)
- 18 unused dependencies removed — smaller attack surface, faster installs
- Zero errors from mypy, ruff, and bandit static analysis
- 7 open issues closed in a single PR, some dating back to 2022
- Repo transferred from stratofax to cadentdev organization

We're a small team, and having 32 agents independently stress-test your code before release is the kind of leverage that changes what's possible. Every vulnerability they surfaced was one we could fix before users ever encountered it.

## v0.1.2 — Modernization & Typer Upgrade (2025-01-09 to 2025-09-14)

A major modernization effort that brought xplat from Python 3.9 to 3.12+, replaced legacy tooling, and rewrote the rename module.

### CLI Overhaul

- Upgraded Typer from 0.12.5 to 0.17.4, resolving critical `Parameter.make_metavar()` crash
- Migrated all CLI options to modern `Annotated[Type, typer.Option()]` syntax
- Added short-form option flags: `-s`, `-o`, `-e`, `-n`, `-i`, `-h`, `-V`
- Added interactive rename mode with per-file confirmation (`--interactive`)
- Non-interactive mode became the default — scripts work without prompts

### Rename Module Rewrite

- Rewrote `renamer.py` as `rename.py` with `rename_file()`, `make_safe_path()`, and `safe_stem()`
- Fixed TypeError crash when renaming files without extension filter (Issue #3)
- Fixed "type None" display when no extension provided (Issue #2)
- Added dry-run with detailed output formatting
- Improved error handling with proper exceptions (`FileNotFoundError`, `FileExistsError`)

### Tooling Migration

- Migrated from Sourcery to Ruff for linting and formatting (10-100x faster)
- Replaced flake8, isort, and black with Ruff
- Added pre-commit hooks (ruff, mypy, bandit)
- Removed 18 unused dependencies (optimize-images, pdf2image, pillow, shellingham, and more)
- Added CLAUDE.md and ROADMAP.md for project documentation

### Quality

- Python version requirement updated from 3.9 to 3.12+
- 17 tests passing across Ubuntu, macOS, and Windows
- MyPy type checking enabled with 0 errors
- Bandit security scanning added
- CI pipeline fixed and green on all 6 matrix jobs

## Pre-release Development History (2022-03 to 2024-12)

The foundations of xplat, built over two years of iterative development before formal versioning.
